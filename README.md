DOOMify is a color quantization tool used for quickly generating retro game textures and sprites. When given a source image, an output image can be exported with its color detail restricted to those found in the given palette, whether it be built-in, or through another image's colors provided by the user.

# Requirements
DOOMify is built with the Qt toolkit, and relies on the <u>**Core, Widgets** and **GUI**</u> Libraries in order to function. It is also reccomended that you have Qt Creator and Designer, even if you will not be working with the DOOMify UI directly.

**<u>Ensure you that you are using a version of Qt 5!</u>**
## Windows
Use the [Qt Online Installer](https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer) to install the components described above. **It is also recommended that you install and use the <u>MinGW Toolchain</u>** over MSVC if you will be building for desktop, although the latter should still work.

## Linux 
```
sudo apt-get install qt5-default
sudo apt install qtcreator
```
